Jasmine C.  0:00  
too. And then if you could start by just like introducing yourself for the record telling, just tell us who you are and like your background, that sort of thing.

Derek Knapick  0:08  
Sure, yeah. No. My name is Dino Derek Knapik. I'm an orthopedic sports medicine surgeon at Washington University in St. Louis. I, you know, I did my training at a university hospitals in Cleveland, where I conducted this research study. I did my fellowship training at Midwest workpiece at Rush University where we took care of the Chicago Bulls and the Chicago White Sox, and I'm currently an orthopedic surgeon here at Washington University where we take care of multiple colleges including multiple professional sports teams. specific interest in new injuries, basically all athletic types of injuries to the shoulder that hit the knee, the foot and ankle. Were obviously any type of injury that occurs especially at the professional level in treating those injuries appropriately.

Jasmine C.  0:54  
Yeah, um, that's awesome. Yeah, I can tell you a lot of experience um, one of the things that I was really interested in so Could you could you kind of just like summarize give me like the 10,000 foot picture of your, your research paper on like the some of the key takeaways or readers should should know

Derek Knapick  1:13  
should they know it's just a paper in current orthopedic practice. That was published I believe, and I think it was clean, clean 2020 or 2019.

Jasmine C.  1:23  
It was the 2021 paper I can email it to you.

Derek Knapick  1:28  
Oh is it is it the injury incidence is higher on artificial turf? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. So, yeah, so this was basically a study that was built out of a, you know, a lack in the literature that basically was looking at injury risk when comparing injuries occurring on artificial turf, versus those occurring on natural grass. You know, the study was really to compare injury incidences and what we did is we collected data from 26 High schools that we took care of in the Cleveland area. We basically looked at injury incidence based on the location whether it was in the upper extremity, the lower extremity or the torso as well as a type of sport that a level of competition that the high school athlete was participating in, namely, they were at the freshman level Junior Varsity or varsity and if the injury was occurring during practice or competition. During this time period, we identified a total of 953 injuries, of which 61% occurred on turf while 39% occurred on grass. What we found through our statistical analysis was that athletes were 58% more likely to sustain injuries on artificial turf, when compared to those injuries sustained on natural grass, especially in athletes who participated in football, soccer and rugby. basically allowing us to concur or sort of conclude that you know upper and lower extremity injuries as well as torso injuries occur with a higher incidence and these high school athletes over a single year season on artificial turf when compared to natural grass.

Jasmine C.  2:56  
Wow, that's really interesting. Um, so I also like took a look at some of the data from iqvia. Like through the NFL, I noticed that their reporting rates that seem like maybe a little lower, more conservative conservative, I was wondering how your studies results generalize, in your opinion to maybe like higher levels of play.

Derek Knapick  3:17  
Absolutely. So the one thing that we really have to be aware of is that a lot of studies in the literature looking at injury incidence when comparing natural grass versus artificial turf, there's a large degree of heterogeneity. And what I mean by that is when it looks at injury rates, really, you know, we can't really do a really, you know, meaningful quantitative meta analysis based on you know, the studies that are out there because there's a large group of there's a large difference when you're looking from study to study looking at the subset of athletes that are participating in different sports, different fitness, competition, ability and planning exposure. And the fact that you know, we always have to be aware too that some of these studies may have some industry sponsorship. And so, you know, it's very difficult to kind of go from, you know, the high school level to the Collegian to the professional level, because there's so many variables that aren't really accounted for. And you know, one of the things that we really are aware of is that not only is it the extrinsic factors that may account for injury, namely extended being, you know, the plain surface and you know, the cleats that the athletes wearing because we know that that shoe surface interface is very important. But there's also a number of intrinsic factors and we know that professional athletes are going to have greater levels of finesse fitness, they're going to be usually stronger versus high school athletes. They may be, you know, this may be one of three sports that they play, you know, throughout the school year. So it's very difficult to kind of make that, you know, generalization comparing one subset of athletes, especially high schoolers, to a subset of athletes, like professional athletes, so it's really hard to make any generalizations not only based on the patient population, but also just the competition level.

Jasmine C.  4:52  
Yeah, no, that's totally understandable. Do you would you would it be accurate to say, though, that the overall finding of artificial turf perhaps being more dangerous could could apply to play like in the NFL, for instance.

Derek Knapick  5:07  
So I think that, you know, if I were to kind of make any type of kind of no sweeping statement, what I would say is that, you know, based on some current literature that's out there, there does appear to be a slightly higher reported incidence of injuries, especially to the foot and the ankle, on artificial turf, especially in football players when compared to natural grass. But again, there's, you know, an equal number of studies out there that unfortunately will, you know, you know, contest those contests, those findings, so, I think that, you know, really what we need kind of going forward, you know, the solution to this kind of question is really the need for really a multicenter prospective study evaluating really a homogenous group of athletes like professionals who participate in both artificial and natural grass plain surfaces, while evaluating really the injury incidents that's recorded that's being recorded through a centralized database. By medical personnel over the course of multiple seasons, to really conclude with any scientific certainty without any industry influence or sponsorship, the true risk of injury between these playing surfaces.

Jasmine C.  6:09  
Yeah, I understand what you sound like a status Yeah, no, no, I'm definitely a I was an economist so like I was Yeah, I see what I see what you're getting at. Okay, um, I guess like one of the things is interesting to me too, is like I know people are focused on like Aaron Rodgers and like, you know, his ACL tear but but this affects, you know, people across all levels of play. Which is something that you've kind of pointed to, I guess, if there's something our readers should should know, like, you know, if their parents and their kids play sports, I guess like, is there like some kind of like, statement or message that you think you'd like to pass on to them?

Derek Knapick  6:51  
Sure. Yeah. No, I think they, you know, the big thing that we are aware of, is the fact that, you know, while artificial turf has its advantages, you know, namely the fact that you know, it's a very popular alternative because it's, you know, it's it's, you know, it's cost friendly, the maintenance is a lot less in the sense that you know, it doesn't you don't have to worry about the same issues like with the grass roots with the you know, the grass freezing in the winter. Or any out summer, is that, you know, while the turf is one element, there's multiple intrinsic and extrinsic variables that you have to be aware of. One of those extrinsic variables is also making sure that you have the right shoe wear. So, whether it's natural grass, grass, or you're playing on artificial turf, it's very important that you know, you are the athlete has the right shoes that they fit appropriately and that you know that they're able to grip the field but again, that's kind of that where it comes you know, are we having Is there too much force you know, Is there too much torque and rotational force on artificial turf, but again, having you know, having the right equipment and it's also, you know, very important, I think, to make sure that we're maintaining, you know, the fields, and, you know, you know, obviously we kind of, you know, one of the things that you know, that's been said about kind of the turf that you know, recently had a very popular athlete injured on there's been multiple issues with it related to, you know, the 40 Niners a couple years ago and some other injuries, making sure that we're maintaining that appropriately, and addressing concerns to keep our athletes healthy. But when we're talking about kind of the younger athletes, it's just making sure that we have the right equipment, but also the intrinsic factors are important in the sense that we make sure that the athletes are able to practice on that turf to some extent that they have the right physique, that they're stretched out that they've gone through all you know, everything that we know, is necessary in order to really minimize the chance of any type of injury from an intrinsic standpoint.

Jasmine C.  8:34  
I see that makes sense. Um, so like, in your opinion, this is just like a bigger level question like what are the most important variables I guess like for in terms of like human service interaction that differentiate like turf and grass?

Derek Knapick  8:51  
So I'm sorry. Can you repeat it real quick?

Jasmine C.  8:56  
Yeah, I guess like what what are the most important like variables? Like when we're when trying to differentiate between turf and grass as some people say like turf is like slicker or like harder? I'm not familiar with each surface, to be honest.

Derek Knapick  9:09  
Oh, absolutely. So, you know, at least what we know is that you know, synthetic turf, you know, is much different than natural grass. You know, when you look at you know, a lot of the studies kind of in the literature, you know, we do know that, you know, there's multiple generations of artificial turf. And, you know, one of the other, you know, limitations is a lot of the studies in the literature really focused on first and second generation artificial turf, which is really obsolete at this point. And that definitely, you know, if you look at those studies, the injury rate was much higher, but now that we're in third and fourth generation of artificial turf, you know, what we know is that, you know, it's, you know, the, the, you know, the ability of athletes to you know, push off and that kind of have a more natural feel when compared to grasses improving. But when you look at a lot of other studies, we still know that, you know, the, there's a much higher degree of torque and rotation that's placed across the foot because there's more stick to the artificial turf than there is natural grass. And that's a benefit and a disadvantage. A little bit because of shoe. You know, if an athlete pushes down, they're less likely to slip as if they were on natural grass, but at the same time, if they're cutting in the direction very quickly, or potentially the foot is sticking to the ground while they're getting hit and falling down. If that foot sticks. Again, that's going to increase the risk of injuries not only to the foot and the ankle, but as well as the need and potentially the hip and torso as well.

Jasmine C.  10:34  
I see. Um, okay. One of the things that we're trying so the reason I asked that question is like, we're trying to think of a way to diagram visually like it like an explainer. For our readers, how the body kind of interacts differently with turf compared to grass because people will keep playing this clip where Rogers kind of like falls over and his ankle bends and like a weird way. And since you're the you know, the expert here in that interaction, I was wondering if there's any, any way you think we could describe that visually, if that makes sense.

Derek Knapick  11:11  
Let me think about that. Um, yeah, because I mean, one of the things I'll tell you is, you know, a lot of it also kind of, you know, not so much at the professional level, but at the collegiate high school level, a lot of it kind of depends on you know, the effect of kind of you know, when they when you look at the cleats, the stud design, can also you know, it can really have an impact on the ground reaction forces and the rotational stiffness that the foot has when you take coming to the surface. I think the thing that you can kind of take away is, you know, when you look at, I think the best way to look at it is, you know, the gripping of the shoe on the turf is it's, you have a lot less grip on national press, when compared to the artificial turf and so you have less slip on the artificial turf, but it may not be as protective against rotational injuries, like, you know, like the athlete we're talking about. And so I think it's more of a sticking issue that you that might be the easiest way to kind of understand it if the has less ability to kind of, I guess, fly and give way, especially as the body moves in an unnatural way, such as when one is tackled, it's more likely to, you know, basically get you get a fixed point of the foot hitting the turf, and that especially with a rotational force can really increase the risk of injury I let me know if I need to kind of reread kind of reevaluate that Jasmine if that makes sense or not.

Jasmine C.  12:43  
Yeah, I think generally, it makes sense. I'm just trying to figure out a way to maybe like analogize or like make make it relatable for a reader right like, like we have a lot of parents who are like should my kid like be worried about this, they play soccer, and we want them to really understand you know, this this experience that may not they may not be able to relate to directly right because they might not play soccer. So that know that that's very helpful. I might, would it be okay, if our graphics designer potentially reaches out for more details on on that specifically? Okay, yeah, that that would that would definitely help. I think she's especially interested in understanding how grass and turf absorbed maybe like divorce or someone's like foot differently, but I obviously everything I'm saying is like conjecture, right, like, I'm not you. So.

Derek Knapick  13:37  
You know, I know that there's a study out there that looked at regional pressures, where they compared synthetic turf versus natural grass and what they found was that there was significantly higher forces and really the central forefoot and the lesser toes, so like the toes on the outside part of the foot, while natural grass had actually significantly higher forces in the medial forefoot and the lateral mid foot and that, you know, this this, this could, you know, account for, you know, potentially the higher risk of foot and ankle injuries. Based on what some studies have reported when they're looking especially at football players when comparing natural versus artificial surfaces.

Jasmine C.  14:12  
Right. I'm not going to pretend to understand all that fully. But that's it. This is all really really interesting and not something I thought of like, I remember like the thought just hit me like the other day was like, wow, these are like 300 pounds. Like kid I college football was watching college football but it was crazy. It was like these are like 300 pound guys like hitting each other that that's a lot of damage for a body to take.

Derek Knapick  14:37  
Not relevant for this, but I mean basically what they've shown is that, you know, every time a blind myth comes at the line and hits their opponents, it's almost equivalent, you know, especially when we're looking at just the context to a small car accident. I mean, it's it's, it's, I mean, especially if you've been on the field and seen it up close, it is incredibly impressive. The impact that these athletes the same multiple times every single game.

Jasmine C.  15:02  
Wow, wow. Yeah, I honestly like the physicality kind of just hit me like, I don't know why, like recently because when you're watching on TV, you don't fully get it. But I was working on a different analytics project on college football and I was like wow, this is crazy. Like because 20 years ago like a lot of players are like 180 pounds or something right? Not 300 or 400 pounds. That is that is wild. If you have like numbers on that I would really appreciate it like, like you just said the equivalent of like a small car accident. I think that's pretty astonishing.

Derek Knapick  15:40  
Yeah, that's Yeah. And that's what you said more for kind of like impact. You know, I can certainly look and see if I can find I don't think anything's been published in the literature. I mean, that's just kind of how we've been, you know, with our results using that. But, you know, like I said, a lot of it's kind of depends on position level of competition. So, I mean, that's probably, I mean, like I said, I don't, I can look and see, but I don't think there's anything that's going to like, you know, compare those and, you know, getting into questions and everything like that. So completely different topics, right,

Jasmine C.  16:09  
right. No, that totally makes sense. We were thinking of expanding this for a future piece to just like a deeper dive in investigating like player safety. So like, I'm definitely would love to hear more from you about this. In the future when it's not so rushed. Um, let's see, I guess like one thing you brought up is that there are some weaknesses and other studies or just the literature's not really complete. I would love to know a little bit more about what some of those, what some of the gaps might be.

Derek Knapick  16:38  
Absolutely. So, you know, one of the least one of the big issues is the fact that you know, the heterogeneity in articles really limits our ability to as you said, kind of make generalizations because if the studies are apples and oranges, you can't compare them side by side. And that really limits our ability to perform any really meaningful meta analysis based on kind of what's out there. Specifically, you know, a lot of studies they're looking at, you know, a single study will look at different sports with different levels of competition, different injury settings. So there's, you know, some pretty significant inherent differences in those studies that really make you know, coming to you know, forming a very scientifically sound conclusion very difficult to do. The other thing that you know, we always have to be aware of is that you know, some studies may be sponsored with industry interest. Typically, if there's, you know, study that's been sponsored by a, you know, an artificial field, turf, you know, corporation, you have to kind of take that, you know, take the findings with a little bit of a grain of salt. So, we got to really be aware of that. But again, you know, it really relates to everything. Like I said, you know, you're also looking at like we talked about different generations of artificial turf. We don't know, you know, a lot of the studies don't report on exactly what kind of artificial turf is used. We know that there's going to be a lot of inherent differences in the quality of natural grass. We know there's going to be a lot of differences in athletes based on their footwear. And so, you know, those really kind of make it difficult to, you know, make a one to one comparison. And again, that's why I really think that you know, a very well designed multicenter prospective study is really needed in order to really truly assess and better understand the risk of injury between playing surfaces.

Jasmine C.  18:24  
That makes sense. I guess, like if there's one thing that you would say to like NFL, in terms of like what I guess like a message that we want to get across, about like player safety, like what what would it be?

Derek Knapick  18:39  
Oh, honestly, it would be let's keep studying this. Let's keep you know, an open discussion about you know, what the data you know, what data is shown. They do a wonderful job of collecting like you had mentioned through iqvia They do a wonderful job of collecting a lot of a lot of data regarding these injuries. Let's keep analyzing this. Let's keep focusing on what the data shows and let's keep you know as we gather more and more data, thinking of ways that we can enhance player safety based on sound scientific conclusions.

Jasmine C.  19:13  
Yeah, no, that's really interesting. Um, how closely do they work with y'all when it comes to like developing, you know, approaches to player safety?

Derek Knapick  19:21  
So, yeah, there, you know, a lot of the times, you know, and that's one of the reasons you know, you know, the NFL really became dedicated to a centralized database where they, you know, record this data through iqvia is, you know, I know, you know, they definitely look at it and, you know, there's multiple studies published almost seemingly every, you know, every other month using that database, and we've, we've published a little bit using that database as well. But you know, they really, they, you know, that they have a great scientific, you know, body that really analyzes that data, and you know, what they, you know, what they'll do is those medical personnel will make suggestions. And, you know, those suggestions are really taken to heart by the NFL because they really, you know, have the best interests of the player in mind, and they really want to do everything they can to you know, not only keep the sport interesting, but keep those athletes on the field.

Jasmine C.  20:09  
Yeah, no, that's definitely interesting. Is there a place where, like, I'm sure the answer is no, but I wanted to ask anyways, we're the, I guess, like, we might be able to see some more of the iqvia data, because like we've seen some of it in the NFLPA reports, but there's, it's not like that public facing.

Derek Knapick  20:27  
Yeah. So to get access to iqvia. You have to be associated with an NFL team. You have to be a physician that is basically certified by the NFL. And there's a vetting process where they look at specifically, what's the quality of the scientific question that you're answering. And if you're the, you know, if you get through and you know, multiple reviews are required, and if they think that the study question really kind of meets the level of interest, that will be answered using the iqvia data, they will provide you with the data that's requested. So it's a very secure way, because we don't want that information, you know, getting out there to the general public. You know, something that, you know, we, you know, the NFL protects and rightly so, because, you know, we're talking about, you know, we're talking about human you know, medical information, so we really want to make sure we're not violating any HIPAA, any HIPAA exceptions. And so they do a good job of really keeping that secure and really only allowing people who are, you know, medical physicians who are you know, clipped you know, associated by with the NFL to allow access to that data and it's a long process but rightfully so.

Jasmine C.  21:36  
Right, right. That makes sense. I know, for us, we don't necessarily need to work with the raw data. We were just hoping to see more research, I guess, or like work with more researchers who are asking questions with it, and report on their research. Because honestly, like even even finding those people has been kind of

Derek Knapick  21:52  
hard. Sure, ya know, and, you know, most of the NFL team physicians will have the opportunity to access that data. But again, it only comes with a sound scientific question that they believe that data will help answer

Jasmine C.  22:05  
that makes sense. Do you have any work that you're doing like like, like on this question, like additional work?

Derek Knapick  22:14  
You know, we, you know, obviously being in St. Louis, we kind of know what happened with the Rams, that we're currently taking care of an NFL team, but I don't like my colleagues are still involved in the NFL. I know they're doing projects. I can't speak to exactly you know what they're doing right now. But, you know, I know that many of the team physicians are still actively engaged. And the NFL really has a robust scientific network work and they are really focused on identifying ways of keeping our players safe.

Jasmine C.  22:42  
Yeah, that's, that's awesome. If you know anyone who might be open to speaking with us, like I'd love if, if you could pass my information on. Yeah, absolutely. Okay, cool. I think that's about it for me. I don't want to take too much time out of your day. I really appreciate you hopping on this. So
